# Math Calculator

This project is a Python-based GUI application that provides tools for solving mathematical problems, including conic classification, linear algebra operations, polynomial root finding, eigenvalue/eigenvector computation, and vector projections. The program is implemented using `Tkinter` for the graphical interface and includes error handling to ensure user-friendly functionality.

## Features

1. **Conic Classification:**
   - Parses conic equations and identifies the type (Circle, Ellipse, Hyperbola, Parabola).
   - Provides the canonical form of the conic for easier interpretation.

2. **Linear System Solver:**
   - Solves systems of linear equations using Gaussian Elimination.
   - Supports matrix input of any size.

3. **Vector Operations:**
   - Performs vector addition, subtraction, dot product, and scalar multiplication.

4. **Matrix Operations:**
   - Handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, transpose, determinant, and inversion.

5. **Polynomial Roots:**
   - Finds roots of polynomials up to degree 2 (quadratic).

6. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors:**
   - Calculates eigenvalues and eigenvectors for matrices up to 3x3.

7. **Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization:**
   - Orthogonalizes a set of vectors using the Gram-Schmidt process.

8. **Projection onto Subspace:**
   - Projects a vector onto a given subspace.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.8+ recommended).
2. Install required libraries if not already available (all used libraries are part of Python's standard library).
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python final.py



conic examples: 

#4x^2-y^2-16x-6y+3=0 hyperbola
#9x^2+16y^2-54x+64y+1=0 ellipse
#x^2 + y^2 - 4 = 0
#-x^2+2x+7-y=0 parabola
#x^2+4x-8y+16=0 parabola
#y^2-4x-6y+9=0 parabola

just copy-paste the equations and get the results
